# 🔐 Caesar Cipher GUI Tool

A simple, fun, and interactive Python application that lets you **encrypt and decrypt messages** using the Caesar Cipher algorithm — all with a colorful GUI!

## 🎯 Features

* ✅ Encrypt or decrypt any message using Caesar Cipher
* ✍️ Supports **multi-line text input**
* 📋 **Auto-copy result** to clipboard
* 📂 Import and export text from `.txt` files
* 🌓 Toggle between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode**
* 🔁 Real-time result update
* 🧼 Reset and clear inputs easily
* 🎨 Colorful and modern look using `Tkinter`
* 📋 Menu bar with file and help options

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6+ recommended)
2. Install Tkinter if it's not already installed (comes by default with Python)
3. Download the code and save as `project1.py`
4. Open your terminal or command prompt
5. Run:

```bash
python project1.py
```

## 📦 Dependencies

* Python’s built-in `tkinter` (for GUI)
* No external libraries required!

## 📚 What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest encryption techniques. It works by **shifting each letter** in a message by a fixed number (the "key"). For example, a shift of `3` turns `A` into `D`, `B` into `E`, and so on.

## 🤝 Contributions

Feel free to improve the design, add new ciphers (like Vigenère or ROT13), or convert this to a web app!
